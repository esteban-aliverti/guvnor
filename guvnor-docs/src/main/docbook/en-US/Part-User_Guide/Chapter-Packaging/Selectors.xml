  <title>Selectors</title>

    <para>When building packages using the "Packages" feature you have the option to use a "selector". 
    This selector will filter the list of rules that are built into the package. </para>

      <title>Built-in Selector</title>
      
      <para>Guvnor provides several built-in selectors which allow you to choose what assets form 
      part of a package build according to asset's status and category. </para>

      <title>Custom Selector</title>

      <para>You can use a custom selector if the built-in selector does not satisfy your requirement.</para>

      <para>To configure a custom selector, you will need to "explode" the WAR file for Guvnor, and locate the
      <filename>selectors.properties</filename> file (note you can also put your own <filename>selectors.properties</filename> 
      file in the system classpath if you like). In this file, you will
      find details on how you can configure a custom selector. The options are to use a DRL file, or the name of
      a class that you have written (and which is available on the classpath). Classes must implement the
      <code>AssetSelector</code> interface. DRL files can also be used and there is an example one in the
      <filename>selectors.properties</filename> file). Each selector you configure has a unique name in this
      properties file - and this is the name that you can use when building packages. </para>
