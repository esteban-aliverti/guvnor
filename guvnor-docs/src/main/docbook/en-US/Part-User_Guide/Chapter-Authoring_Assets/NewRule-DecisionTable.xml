  <title>Guided decision tables (web based)</title>

  <para>The guided decision table feature allows decision tables to be edited
  in place on the web. This works similar to the guided editor by
  introspecting what facts and fields are available to guide the creation of a
  decision table. Rule attributes, meta-data, conditions and actions can be
  defined in a tabular format thus facilitating rapid entry of large sets of
  related rules. Web-based decision table rules are compiled into DRL like all
  other rule assets.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Types of decision table</title>

    <para>There are boradly two different types of decision table, both of
    which are supported in Guvnor:-</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Extended Entry</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Limited Entry</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <section>
      <title>Extended Entry</title>

      <para>An Extended Entry decision table is one for which the column
      definitons, or stubs, specify Pattern, Field and operator but not value.
      The values, or states, are themselves held in the body of the decision
      table. It is normal, but not essential, for the range of possible values
      to be restricted by limiting entry to values from a list. Guvnor
      supports use of Java enumerations, Guvnor enumerations or decision table
      "optional value lists" to restrict value entry.</para>

      <title>Limited Entry</title>

      <para>A Limited Entry decision table is one for which the column
      definitions specify value in addition to Pattern, Field and operator.
      The decision table states, held in the body of the table, are boolean
      where a positive value (a checked tick-box) has the effect of meaning
      the column should apply, or be matched. A negative value (a cleared
      tick-box) means the column does not apply.</para>

    <title>Main components\concepts</title>

    <para>The guided decision table is split into two main sections:-</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The upper section allows table columns to be defined
        representing rule attributes, meta-data, conditions and
        actions.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The lower section contains the actual table itself; where
        individual rows define seperate rules.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <section>
      <title>Navigation</title>

      <para>Cells can be selected in a variety of ways:-</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Firstly individual cells can be double-clicked and a pop-up
          editor corresponding to the underlying data-type will appear. Groups
          of cells in the same column can be selected by either clicking in
          the first and dragging the mouse pointer or clicking in the first
          and clicking the extent of the required range with the shift key
          pressed.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Secondly the keyboard cursor keys can be used to navigate
          around the table. Pressing the enter key will pop-up the
          correspondig editor. Ranges can be selected by pressing the shift
          key whilst extending the range with the cursor keys.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Columns can be resized by hovering over the corresponding divider
      in the table header. The mouse cursor will change and then the column
      width dragged either narrower or wider.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Cell merging</title>

      <para>The icon in the top left of the decision table toggles cell
      merging on and off. When cells are merged those in the same column with
      identical values are merged into a single cell. This simplifies changing
      the value of multiple cells that shared the same original value. When
      cells are merged they also gain an icon in the top-left of the cell that
      allows rows spanning the merged cell to be grouped.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Cell grouping</title>

      <para>Cells that have been merged can be further collapsed into a single
      row. Clicking the [+\-] icon in the top left of a merged cell collapses
      the corresponding rows into a single entry. Cells in other columns
      spanning the collapsed rows that have identical values are shown
      unchanged. Cells in other columns spanning the collapsed rows that have
      different values are highlighted and the first value displayed.</para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>When the value of a grouped cell is altered all cells that have
      been collapsed also have their values updated.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Operation of "otherwise"</title>

      <para>Condition columns defined with literal values that use either the
      equality (==) or inequality (!=) operators can take advantage of a
      special decision table cell value of "otherwise". This special value
      allows a rule to be defined that matches on all values not explicitly
      defined in all other rules defined in the table. This is best
      illustrated with an example:-</para>

      <programlisting>when
  Cheese( name not in ("Cheddar", "Edam", "Brie") )
  ...
then
  ...
end</programlisting>

      <programlisting>when
  Cheese( name in ("Cheddar", "Edam", "Brie") )
  ...
then
  ...
end</programlisting>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Re-arranging columns</title>

      <para>Whole patterns and individual conditions can be re-arranged by
      dragging and dropping them in the configuration section of the screen.
      This allows constraints to be re-ordered to maximise performance of the
      resulting rules, by placing generalised constraints before more
      specific. Action columns can also be re-arranged by dragging and
      dropping them.</para>

      <title>Manual creation</title>

      <para>When a new empty decision table has been created you need to
      define columns for Facts, their constraints and corresponding
      actions.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Column configuration</title>

        <para>Expand the "Decision table" element and you will see three
        further sections for "Conditions", "Actions" and "Options". Expanding
        either the "Conditions" or "Actions" sections reveals the "New column"
        icon. This can be used to add new column definitions to the
        corresponding section. Existing columns can be removed by clicking the
        "-" icon beside each column name, or edited by clicking the "pencil"
        icon also beside each column name. The "Options" section functions
        slightly differently however the principle is the same: clicking the
        "Add Attribute/Metadata" icon allows columns for table attributes to
        be defined (such as "salience", "no-loop" etc) or metadata
        added.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Utility columns</title>

          <para>Two columns containing rule number and description are
          provided by default.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Attribute columns</title>

          <para>Zero or more attribue columns representing any of the DRL rule
          attributes can be added. An additional pseudo attribute is provide
          in the guided decision table editor to "negate" a rule. Use of this
          attribute allows complete rules to be negated. For example the
          following simple rule can be negated as also shown.</para>

          <programlisting>when
  $c : Cheese( name == "Cheddar" )
then
  ...
end</programlisting>

          <programlisting>when
  not Cheese( name == "Cheddar" )
then
  ...
end</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Meta-data columns</title>

          <para>Zero or more meta-data columns can be defined, each represents
          the normal meta-data annotation on DRL rules.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Condition columns</title>

          <para>Conditions represent fact patterns defined in the right-hand
          side, or "when" portion, of a rule. To define a condition column you
          must define a binding to a model class or select one that has
          previously been defined. You can choose to negate the pattern. Once
          this has been completed you can define field constraints. If two or
          more columns are defined using the same fact pattern binding the
          field constraints become composite field constraints on the same
          pattern. If you define multiple bindings for a single model class
          each binding becomes a seperate model class in the right-hand side
          of the rule.</para>

          <para>When you edit or create a new column, you will be given a
          choice of the type of constraint:-</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Literal : The value in the cell will be compared with the

        use the "&gt;&gt;" button to add it to your list of chosen facts on
        the right-hand listbox. Removal is a similar process: the Fact that is
        no longer required can be selected in the right-hand listbox and the
        "&lt;&lt;" button used to remove it. All Fact types need to be bound
        to a variable. Incomplete Fact types will be highlighted and a warning

        on the previous Wizard page are listed in the right-hand listbox.
        Selecting a Fact type by clicking on it will result in a list of
        available fields being shown in the middle listbox together with an
        option to create a predicate that do not require a specific field.
        Fields can be added to the pattern's constraints by clicking on the
        field and then the "&gt;&gt;" button. Fields can be removed from the
        pattern definition by clicking on the Condition in the right-hand
        listbox and then the "&lt;&lt;" button. All fields need to have a
        column header and operator. Incomplete fields will be highlighted and
        a warning message displayed. You will be unable to finish your

        to be defined. Fact types added to the decision table definition are
        listed in the left-hand listbox. Selecting a Fact type by clicking on
        it will result in a list of available fields being shown in the middel
        listbox. Fields that need to be updated by the rule can be added by
        selecting an available field and pressing the "&gt;&gt;" button.
        Fields can be removed similarly by clicking on a chosen field and then
        the "&lt;&lt;" button. All actions require a column header. Any
        incomplete actions will be highlighted and a warning message
        displayed. You will be unable to finish your definition until all
        warnings have been resolved.</para>

        <title>Add Actions to insert facts page</title>

        <para>Actions can also be defined to insert new Facts into the Rule
        Engine. A list of Fact types available in your model are listed in the
        left-hand listbox. Select those you wish to include in your decision
        table definition by clicking on them and pressing the "&gt;&gt;"
        button between the left most listbox and that titled "Chosen
        patterns". Removal is a similar process whereby a chosen pattern can
        be selected and removed by pressing the "&lt;&lt;" button. Selection
        of a chosen pattern presents the user with a list of available fields.
        Fields that need to have values set by the action can be added by
        selecting them and pressing the "&gt;&gt;" button between the
        "Available fields" and "Chosen fields" listbox. Removal is a similar
        process as already described. New Facts need to be bound to a variable
        and have a column heading specified. Incomplete Facts and\or fields
        will be highlighted and a warning message displayed. You will be
        unable to finish your definition until all warnings have been
        resolved.</para>

        <title>Columns to expand page</title>

        <para>This page controls how the decision table, based upon Conditions
        defined on the prior pages, will be created. Condition columns defined
        with an optional list of permitted values can be used to create rows
        in the decision table. Where a number of Condition columns have been
        defined with lists of permitted values the resulting table will
        contain a row for every combination of values; i.e. the decision table
        will be in expanded form. By default all Condition columns defined
        with value lists will be included in the expansion however you are
        able to select a sub-set of columns if so required. This can be
        accomplished by unticking the "Fully expand" checkbox and adding
        columns to the right-hand listbox. If no expansion is required untick
        the "Fully expand" checkbox and ensure zero columns are added to the
        right-hand listbox.</para>
