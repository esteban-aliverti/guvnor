  <title>Creating a package</title>

  <para>Configuring packages is generally something that is done once, and by
  someone with some experience with rules/models. Generally speaking, very few
  people will need to configure packages, and once they are setup, they can be
  copied over and over if needed. Package configuration is most definitely a
  technical task that requires the appropriate expertise.</para>

  <para>All assets live in "packages" in the Guvnor - a package is like a
  folder (it also serves as a "namespace"). A home folder for rule assets to
  live in. Rules in particular need to know what the fact model is, what the
  namespace is etc.</para>

  <para>So while rules (and assets in general) can appear in any number of
  categories, they only live in one package. If you think of the Guvnor as a
  file system, then each package is a folder, and the assets live in that
  folder - as one big happy list of files. When you create a deployment
  snapshot of a package, you are effectively copying all the assets in that
  "folder" into another special "folder".</para>

  <para>To create an empty package select "New Package" from the "Create new"
  (asset) menu.</para>

    <title>Empty package</title>

    <para>An empty package can be created by simply specifying a name and
    optional description.</para>

    <title>Importing DRL packages</title>

    <para>It is also possible to create a package by importing an existing DRL
    file. When you choose to create a new package, you can choose an option to
    upload a <filename>.drl</filename> file. The Guvnor will then attempt to
    understand that DRL, break create a package for you. The rules in it will
    be stored as individual assets (but still as DRL text content). Note that
    to actually build the package, you will need to upload an appropriate
    model (as a JAR) to validate against, as a separate step.</para>
