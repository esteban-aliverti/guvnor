  <title>Navigating and finding rules</title>

  <para>The two main ways of viewing the repository are by using the Package
  Explorer or user-driven Categorization (tagging) as outlined
  previously.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Package explorer</title>

    <para>The Package Explorer appears in the "Knowledge Bases" section of the
    left-hand side navigation bar. The Package Explorter shows a list of all
    packages (other than those that have been archived).</para>

    <para>The list of packages can either be viewed hierarchically or flat and
    fully expanded or collapsed using the icons below the tree-view.</para>

    <para>Clicking on a package name in the tree-view will launch the Asset
    Viewer.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Asset Viewer</title>

      <para>The Asset Viewer is launched when a package in the Package
      Explorer is clicked.</para>

      <para>The Asset Viewer shows a list of assets in the package grouped by
      their type. If no assets exist in the package a warning is
      displayed.</para>

      <para>Expanding a section using the [+] icon reveals the assets
      contained therein.</para>

      <para>Assets are listed in a table that can be paged forwards or
      backwards and can be opened by either clicking their respective "Open"
      button, or selecting the required rows and clicking the "Open selected"
      button. Multiple assets can be opened into a single editor by selecting
      the required rows and clicking the "Open selected to single tab"
      button.</para>

      <title>Package configuration</title>

      <para>A package can be configured by clicking on the "Edit" tab on the
      Asset Viewer.</para>

      <para>The facilities here relate to compiling the package into a binary
      form. The "Packaging" section of this user-guide provides a detailed
      narrative on this section.</para>

    <title>Category view</title>

    <para>The category view provides a way to navigate your rules in a way
    that makes sense to your organization.</para>

    <para>The above diagram shows categories in action. Generally under each
    category you should have no more then a few dozen rules, if
    possible.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Inbox and comments</title>

    <para>Built into the Guvnor are two useful features to helping manage
    changes: an Inbox, and a comments section. These features do not affect
    any execution or access to rules, but are purely for documentation and
    notification purposes, and are of course always optional to use.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Inbox</title>

      <para>In the "browse" section of the application, there is an "Inbox"
      tree item, below this are 3 inboxes. "Incoming changes" contains changes
      to any artifacts that the current logged in user has edited in the past,
      or commented on. Simply editing or commenting on an artifact registers
      interest in it to be notified of changes the next time you log
      in."Recently opened" contains items that have been recently opened
      (simply opening an artifact will make it appear here, the last 100
      recently opened items will appear here). "Recently edited" contains the
      last 100 recently edited items (artifacts that the current user has made
      changes to).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Comments</title>

      <para>Below the documentation box of each artifact, is a "comments"
      section - simply, you can add a new comment. Administrators can clear
      all comments on a given artifact, but other users can only append
      comments. Each comment records what user made the comment, and when.
      Users who can't edit artifacts can still comment on them.</para>
